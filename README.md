# Standalone-Flatpak-Apps
Like `.exe`'s and `.AppImage`'s, Flatpak apps can be saved as standalone `.flatpak` bundles, which can be installed fully offline. Annoyingly, no one ever makes these bundles available for download, so I always need to build them myself. >:(

This repository contains a collection of Flatpak bundles, ready to be backed up for when a zombie apocolypse destroys the internet forever.

*At any given time, these are most likely out of date. I make no commitment to keeping them updated.*
